    <h2>ANNOTATION </h2>

    <p>Yevheniia Kuznietsova’s novel The Ladder (2023) is a moving yet ironic story about a Ukrainian family forced to leave their home and rebuild their lives in a foreign country. The protagonist, Tolik, an IT specialist in his thirties, has bought a house in Spain hoping for solitude and peace, far from his overbearing relatives. However, within weeks of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, his quiet refuge turns into a shelter for his entire family fleeing the war. His mother, his disabled uncle in a wheelchair, a distant aunt with her dog, his older sister and her depressed friend — as well as several pets — suddenly occupy his supposedly safe, carefully arranged home. Each arrives with their fears, habits, traumas, and memories of the life they were forced to abandon.</p>
    <p>Despite his initial resistance, Tolik must learn to coexist with the very people he once tried to escape. The Ladder blends humour with emotional depth, revealing how war transforms individuals even at a distance from the frontline. The novel captures the fragile daily life of forced migrants, the search for psychological balance, and the unexpected ways family bonds can become a source of support in times of crisis. This is a story about exile, resilience, and the rediscovery of home.</p>

    <h2>REVIEW </h2>

    <p>The Ladder stands out as one of the most insightful Ukrainian novels about the experience of war beyond the battlefield — a story of forced migration, disrupted identities, and the fragile dynamics of family life under extreme pressure. Kuznietsova focuses not on grand historical events but on their quiet aftershocks in everyday interactions: kitchen quarrels, intrusive care, misunderstandings, attempts to keep routines, and the struggle for personal space. The novel’s poignant strength lies in its blend of humour and trauma. Without resorting to pathos or heavy symbolism, the author builds psychological tension through gestures, silences, repeated domestic scenes, and intimate emotional details that reflect the characters’ hidden fears and coping mechanisms.</p>
    <p>The ladder that Tolik uses to enter his room becomes a symbolic expression of his detachment, his avoidance of responsibility, and his fear of intimacy. At the same time, it is a metaphor for inner flight — an attempt to protect the illusion of autonomy when life demands solidarity. Each member of the household carries their own version of loss: guilt for those left behind, depression, exhaustion, and the identity rupture of displacement. Their shared space becomes a miniature society in exile, marked by vulnerability but also the ability to support one another.</p>
    <p>Kuznietsova’s language is vivid, natural, and emotionally precise. Her narrative reveals how war reshapes the behaviour of people who are physically safe but still live within emotional landscapes defined by fear and uncertainty. The novel offers a subtle, truthful portrait of a generation forced to move, to rebuild themselves, and to navigate between two worlds. Blending warmth with pain, The Ladder is a powerful contribution to contemporary Ukrainian war literature.</p>

    <h2>SUMMARY </h2>

    <p>Tolik, a successful programmer in his thirties, moves to Spain in search of peace and independence. He buys a house, sets up a workroom, and imagines a life free from the meddling and pressure of his family. To protect his privacy, he even constructs a separate “entrance” — a ladder outside his window, which allows him to avoid common areas of the house.</p>
    <p>After 24 February, everything changes. His mother, fleeing shelling in Kharkiv, arrives first, bringing two cats and her habitual need to manage his life. Soon his uncle, who has lost a leg and uses a wheelchair, joins them. Then comes Aunt Hryhorivna with her dog, followed by his older sister Irosia, shaken by anxiety, and her friend Polina, who is struggling with depression.</p>
    <p>Tolik’s quiet home becomes an overcrowded refuge full of conflicting habits, emotional wounds, and constant tension. Family members interfere in his routines, argue, try to organise the space as they used to at home, and cope with their fears in different ways. Tolik attempts to hide, but escape becomes impossible.</p>
    <p>Gradually, the family begins to adjust. His mother becomes less controlling; Irosia slowly regains stability; Polina emerges from her depression; the uncle rediscovers humour; and Hryhorivna softens as she feels supported. Each character passes through their own stage of grief for the lost homeland. Their shared life becomes a way to survive psychologically during exile.</p>
    <p>Tolik realises that the ladder he guarded so jealously no longer protects him from closeness but prevents him from growing. He begins to accept his new role within the family, giving up his desire to flee. The novel closes quietly but meaningfully: the family remains together, supporting one another amid uncertainty, while Tolik finds a new understanding of himself and what “home” truly means.</p>
