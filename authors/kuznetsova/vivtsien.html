    <h2> Plot summary of the novel “The Sheep Are Safe” by Ievheniia Kuznietsova </h2>

    <p> Yana, a PhD student working on her dissertation, returns to Ukraine for the first time since the full-scale invasion. She arrives in her village at the very beginning of winter. Her parents’ house looks picturesque enough for Instagram, but the power outages and cold do little to brighten her stay at home. However, she has an academic task to complete: gathering information about winter rituals in her region for her dissertation. Yet life has other plans for her. </p>
    <p>When an attractive artist, Maksym, invites her over for cherry pastries, she hesitates but eventually agrees. This marks the beginning of her winter adventures in the village, from the feast day of Saint Roman the Great Martyr (December 1) to Epiphany (January 19). Yana and Maksym are drawn to each other, though both carry their own fears and wounds that must be overcome. Amid the hum of generators, the sounds of air-defense systems, explosions, and the frozen grey of winter, they hope to find a quiet place of their own — even if it’s just a bathroom during a ballistic attack.</p>
    <p>Different people gather in one house, trying to revive a lost sense of joy, unity, and family — at least during the holidays. And although old traditions have become subjects of academic research and resemble role-playing games, they still allow everyone to come together. Yana’s journey ends on Epiphany, forcing her to make a difficult choice between love and her original plans.</p>
       <h2> About the novel “The Sheep Are Safe” by Ievheniia Kuznietsova</h2>
 <p>The novel “The Sheep Are Safe” immerses readers in the familiar realities of life during today’s Russian-Ukrainian war. Ievheniia Kuznietsova writes with wit and clarity, using unexpected metaphors and comparisons. The dialogues capture the natural speech of the characters, making the story more vivid and realistic. The author masterfully conveys the atmosphere of a cold, bleak winter that also mirrors the internal state of the characters, frozen in uncertainty as they wait for the “spring” of their souls.</p>
    <p>The imperfections of the characters, their doubts and fears add truthfulness and emotional depth to the story. The writer speaks of life in all its randomness, anxiety, discomfort, loneliness, and loss — but also in its care and love. This is a novel about hope, light, and human closeness that can be found even in the hardest of times. Family, support, self-search and self-recovery are also central themes. The book will appeal to readers interested in contemporary Ukrainian fiction and deep emotional stories told with simplicity and authenticity.</p>
