    <h2>Biography</h2>

    <p>
        Yevheniia Kuznetsova (born 30 June 1987 in Kryvyi Rih) is a Ukrainian writer, translator, and media researcher. 
        She spent her childhood in Khomutyntsi in the Vinnytsia region. She studied at the Institute of International Relations 
        of Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv and later at the University of Deusto (Spain), where she received her PhD 
        in International and Intercultural Studies in 2015.
    </p>

    <p>
        She has worked as a journalist, taught postcolonial studies, and served as a consultant for international organisations, 
        including the UN and the OSCE. She has also taken part in research projects on Ukrainian media space. 
        Her academic interests include media language analysis, internet anthropology, the role of media in society, 
        and media systems research.
    </p>

    <p>
        Kuznetsova debuted with the humorous culinary book “Cooking in Sorrow” (2020). She gained wide recognition with her first work 
        of fiction, “Ask Miechka” (2021), shortlisted for the BBC Book of the Year Award. Her later books — “The Ladder”, 
        “Language is a Sword”, and her new novel “The Sheep Intact” (2025) — established her as one of the leading voices 
        in contemporary Ukrainian literature.
    </p>

    <p>
        As a translator, she has worked with both fiction and non-fiction, including Doris Goodwin’s biography of Lincoln, 
        Thomas Nichols’s “The Death of Expertise”, and the novels “A Kiss in Paris” and “A Kiss in New York”.
    </p>

    <p>
        She notes that Ukrainian has always been her native language, although there was a period when she switched easily to Russian. 
        A decisive turning point came during a trip abroad in 2009 when she realised the importance of linguistic identity.
    </p>

    <p>
        She lives between Ukraine and Spain, raises two children, and combines literary, translation, and research work.
