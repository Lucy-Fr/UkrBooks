<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Oksana Maksymchuk is a Ukrainian-American poet, translator, and philosopher, one of the most prominent contemporary authors whose work combines intellectual depth, sensitivity to historical memory, and the lived experience of war and forced displacement. She writes in both Ukrainian and English and works at the intersection of poetry, translation, and academic thought. Her English-language collection <em>Still City: Diary of an Invasion</em> became one of the most discussed books about Russia’s full-scale war against Ukraine, while her translations of Ukrainian poetry have brought her international recognition.</p>

<h2>Biography</h2>
<p>Oksana Maksymchuk was born on April 4, 1982, in Lviv. She is the daughter of the well-known Ukrainian theatre actor Sviatoslav Maksymchuk and a physician. In 1997 she moved to the United States with her mother (Urbana, Illinois), where she studied at University Laboratory High School.</p>

<p>She received her higher education at Bryn Mawr College (BA, 2004), where she studied Peace and Conflict Studies and Philosophy in cooperation with Haverford College. During her studies she researched truth and reconciliation commissions, issues of freedom, authenticity and technology in 20th-century philosophy, and completed an internship at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. She was awarded the Dorothy Nepper Marshall Fellowship as one of the college’s top social-science students.</p>

<p>She earned her PhD in Philosophy at Northwestern University. Her dissertation focused on Plato’s doctrine of measure in the dialogue <em>Protagoras</em>. Her academic work combines ancient philosophy, ethics, and questions of civic virtue and moral education.</p>

<p>She lives between Lviv, the United States, and various European cities, working as a poet, translator, researcher, and lecturer, and participating in international literary residencies and translation projects.</p>
