    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
Volodymyr Volodymyrovych Vakulenko (pseudonyms — Volodymyr Vakulenko-K., VKV; 1 July 1972, Kapytolivka village, Kharkiv region — spring 2022, murdered by Russian occupiers) was a Ukrainian writer, poet, translator, civic activist, editor, and cultural organizer, one of the notable figures of the contemporary literary process of Eastern Ukraine. His name became a symbol of the unity of literary creativity, civic stance, and personal courage in wartime. The author of more than a dozen books for adults and children, compiler of anthologies and journals, and an active participant in cultural initiatives, Vakulenko consistently defended Ukrainian identity through both word and action. He was posthumously awarded the title Hero of Ukraine and state distinctions for his contribution to culture and civic bravery.
    </p>

    <h2>Biography</h2>
    <p>
Volodymyr Vakulenko was born on 1 July 1972 in the village of Kapytolivka, Izium district, Kharkiv region. He studied in local schools and received the qualification of pastry chef at Izium Vocational School No. 24. He began working early and held various jobs, including repair and maintenance work. In 1991–1992 he served in the Soviet army, where he became disabled and was discharged. He was the father of two sons.
    </p>

    <p>
He began writing in childhood, and from the early 2000s he was actively published in regional and national press. He participated in literary associations in Izium and Kostiantynivka, served as editor and compiler of several almanacs and periodicals, worked on the translation journal “DzeRkaLo,” and coordinated artistic and publishing projects. His works were translated into several languages.
    </p>

    <p>
Vakulenko was an active participant in civic life: he joined the Revolution of Dignity, volunteered, organized cultural events and literary festivals in Slobozhanshchyna and Donetsk regions, and worked on inclusive book projects for visually impaired children based on universal design principles.
    </p>

    <p>
In the spring of 2022, during the Russian occupation of the Izium region, the writer was abducted by Russian soldiers from his home. Before that, he buried a handwritten diary in his garden, asking that it be given to people “when ours return.” After the liberation of the territory, Vakulenko’s body was identified among mass graves through DNA examination. The circumstances of his death became the subject of a criminal investigation. He is buried in Kharkiv. His wartime diary was later published posthumously and became one of the strongest literary testimonies about life under occupation.
    </p>

    <h2>Works</h2>
    <p>
Volodymyr Vakulenko’s creative legacy includes poetry, prose, translations, children’s literature, and editorial projects. His writing combines nonconformist tone, civic sharpness, and attention to the inner world of the individual. A distinct direction of his work was children’s books created according to inclusive principles, which made him an important figure in the development of socially responsible publishing.
    </p>

    <p>
Among his most well-known publications are the poetry collections “Monogramota,” “Vy…ne,” “My, Province!”, children’s books “The Sun Family” and “Dad’s Book,” the prose work “Infarction for Gourmets. Diary of a Madman,” poetry books “Sviatoslav’s Svarga,” “UBD-Reincarnation,” fairy-tale editions, and other projects. He also compiled anthologies and journals, including the Eastern Ukrainian anthology “Kalmius,” initiated interregional and international literary bridges, and worked with translations and cultural collaborations.
    </p>

    <p>
A special place belongs to the posthumously published book “I Am Transforming… Occupation Diary. Selected Poems,” which combines diary entries from the first months of the full-scale war, poetry for children and adults, and testimonies of contemporaries. This text became not only a literary work but also a historical document — evidence of dignity, faith in victory, and the resilience of Ukrainian cultural memory.
