    <h2> Introduction</h2>
    <p> Victoria Amelina is a Ukrainian novelist, essayist, poet, and war-crimes researcher whose literary work and civic engagement made her one of the most significant voices of contemporary Ukrainian culture. The author of two novels and a children’s book, a laureate of the Joseph Conrad Literary Award and a finalist for the European Union Prize for Literature, she combined fiction writing with human-rights documentation during Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Her prose and poetry, translated into numerous languages, explore themes of memory, post-Soviet transformation, and war, creating a powerful space of testimony and moral reflection. </p>

    <h2> Biography</h2>
    <p>Viktoriia Yuriyivna Amelina (née Shalamay) was born on 1 January 1986 in Lviv, Ukraine. At the age of fourteen she emigrated to Canada with her father but soon returned to Ukraine. She earned a degree in computer science in Lviv and initially worked in the IT sector before turning to full-time writing in 2015. </p><p>

Her debut novel, The Fall Syndrome, or Homo Compatiens (2014/2015), addressed the events of the 2014 Maidan and received critical acclaim as well as several literary awards. In 2016 she published a children’s book, Somebody, or Water Heart, followed in 2017 by the novel Dom’s Dream Kingdom, set in 1990s Lviv and centered on a former apartment of the Polish-Jewish writer Stanisław Lem. The novel was shortlisted for major Ukrainian and European literary prizes and later attracted international publishing interest. </p><p>

Amelina was a member of PEN International and participated in the 84th World PEN Congress, where she spoke in defense of Ukrainian political prisoners. In 2021 she received the Joseph Conrad Korzeniowski Literary Prize and founded a literature festival in the Donetsk region. From 2022 onward she increasingly wrote poetry, describing war as a force that compresses language and intensifies the weight of every word. </p><p>

After the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion, Amelina worked as a war-crimes researcher with the Ukrainian organization Truth Hounds, interviewing witnesses and documenting evidence. In September 2022, while conducting research in the Izium region, she discovered the war diary of the murdered Ukrainian writer Volodymyr Vakulenko and later accepted a posthumous international publishing award on his behalf. She also supported internally displaced people and organized humanitarian aid in Lviv. </p><p>

Her final major project was the non-fiction book Looking at Women Looking at War, a diary-based work focused on women seeking justice during wartime. The manuscript remained unfinished at the time of her death but was later completed and published posthumously, receiving the Orwell Prize for Political Writing in 2025. </p><p>

On 27 June 2023, Victoria Amelina was critically injured in a Russian missile strike on Kramatorsk. She died from her injuries on 1 July 2023 in a hospital in Dnipro at the age of 37 and was buried in Lviv. She is remembered as a writer who united literature, memory, and civic responsibility in the face of war.

    <h2>Wartime work</h2>
    
    <p>
After the beginning of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Victoria Amelina joined the Ukrainian human-rights organization Truth Hounds, which documents war crimes and violations of international humanitarian law. Drawing on her skills as a novelist, she conducted in-depth interviews with witnesses and survivors, combining literary sensitivity with investigative precision. A significant part of her time during the war was devoted to documenting evidence, field research, and analytical work connected with the ongoing conflict. </p><p>
In September 2022, while working in the Izium region, Amelina discovered the hidden wartime diary of the Ukrainian children’s writer Volodymyr Vakulenko, who had been abducted and killed by Russian occupying forces earlier that year. The diary, buried in a garden in the village of Kapytolivka, became an important document of civilian testimony under occupation. Later, Amelina represented Vakulenko’s literary legacy in the Kharkiv Literary Museum and, in May 2023, accepted on his behalf a posthumous award from the International Publishers Association, helping to ensure international recognition of his work and fate. </p><p>
Alongside her investigative efforts, Amelina was actively involved in civic and humanitarian initiatives. She hosted internally displaced Ukrainians in her home and contributed to the delivery of humanitarian aid in Lviv, combining literary, research, and volunteer activities as interconnected forms of responsibility during wartime. </p><p>
The war also profoundly transformed her poetic voice. Several of her poems, included in the anthology Between the Sirens, are united by the leitmotif of loss — fallen soldiers, civilians killed during air-raid alerts, and the loss of home. Her lines resonate with the broader poetic response to war, expressing the sense that “the reality of war / devours punctuation / the coherence of the plot,” and the early realization that only poetry seemed possible in the first months of invasion, even as language itself appeared outdated and insufficient for new circumstances: “Fragments of language / resemble poetry / but are not it.” This writing often carries a motif of abrupt interruption, most vividly in the poem “Air Raid,” where “a shell has struck,” capturing the sudden rupture that defines wartime existence.
