    <p>
      Some phrases outlive the news cycle. They are not merely words — they are buttons. You press them and an entire set of ready-made
      emotions lights up: pride, anxiety, anger, exhilaration. The Russian slogan “We can do it again” (in Russian: “Можем повторить”)
      is exactly that kind of button. Short, rough-edged, and almost jokey at first glance, it has become one of the most visible catchphrases
      of recent years. But what, precisely, is supposed to be “done again” — and why is this formula so convenient for propaganda?
    </p>

    <p>
      Taken literally, the phrase refers to the Soviet Union’s victory in World War II — framed in Russia’s official tradition as the “Great Patriotic War.”
      This event has long been turned into a central element of a national myth: victory as proof of historical rightness, strength, and “sacrifice.”
      “Doing it again” here means “winning again.” But against whom? Under what conditions? And at what cost? The slogan does not specify —
      and that ambiguity is deliberate. Its power lies in what it leaves unsaid. It becomes universal precisely because it is not anchored in facts.
    </p>

    <p>
      That universality makes it an extremely effective tool of mass communication. Contemporary politics is complex: geopolitics, economics,
      moral dilemmas, international law — all of this demands explanation, nuance, and debate. The slogan offers a shortcut: don’t analyze — feel.
      Don’t disentangle — remember. Memory of victory functions like an emotional battery that can be “plugged into” any present-day conflict.
      The result is a simplified, binary picture: “we are the victors / they are the enemies.”
    </p>

    <p>
      There is another effect as well. “We can do it again” produces the image of a nation as an “eternal winner” for whom war is not a tragedy
      but a trial that makes you stronger. It is the language of power, the language of readiness for a new confrontation. It mobilizes, unites,
      and provides a sense of historical mission. Because it is so concise, the phrase easily turns into a meme, a bumper sticker, a slogan on a T-shirt.
      It spreads fast: memes travel faster than arguments because they require no evidence — only recognition.
    </p>

    <p>
      But this effectiveness has a darker reverse side. For many, “We can do it again” sounds like a trivialization of war itself.
      Behind the word “victory” stand millions of dead, destroyed cities, and generational trauma. When tragedy becomes a slogan, memory stops being
      a space for reflection and turns into a resource for the politics of the present. Critics see here not respect for history but its exploitation:
      instead of “remember so it never happens again,” the logic shifts toward “remember so we can repeat it.”
    </p>

    <p>
      The slogan works precisely because it appeals not to facts but to feelings. It does not tell a history — it triggers a reaction.
      That is its propagandistic strength and, at the same time, its vulnerability. The shorter the formula, the more meaning can be poured into it —
      and the easier it becomes to replace one meaning with another. The memory of the past becomes the language of the present, and the language of the present
      becomes a device for legitimizing decisions that shape the future.
    </p>

    <p>
      “We can do it again” is neither an archival quotation nor a document of its time. It is a contemporary political construct designed for instant
      recognition and immediate mobilization. It shows how easily collective memory can be converted into rhetorical capital — and how difficult it is to keep
      the line between engaging with history and instrumentalizing it. The question that remains offstage is simple and uncomfortable:
      what, exactly, do we want to “do again” — and are we prepared to repeat everything that this phrase implies?
