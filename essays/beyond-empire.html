        <p>
            In recent decades, discussions of empire have increasingly shifted from political history to the realm of culture and memory. 
            Empires do not disappear the moment borders change or flags are lowered. They persist in narratives, symbols, school curricula, 
            media imagery, and literary canons. What remains after empire is not only geopolitical influence but a structure of imagination — 
            a way of telling stories about the past and assigning value to languages, identities, and regions.
        </p>

        <p>
            To move beyond empire therefore requires more than political transformation; it demands a cultural and narrative reorientation. 
            Literature plays a central role in this process because it is both a repository of memory and a laboratory of new meanings. 
            Novels, poems, memoirs, and essays often preserve the emotional truth of historical experience long before official archives or 
            institutions are ready to acknowledge it.
        </p>

        <p>
            At the same time, literary texts can dismantle inherited hierarchies by shifting perspective: the marginal voice becomes central, 
            the previously silenced narrator speaks, and familiar myths begin to fracture. In this sense, literature does not merely reflect 
            change — it actively participates in re-writing collective memory.
        </p>

        <p>
            Media environments intensify this dynamic. News platforms, social networks, documentary film, and digital storytelling accelerate 
            the circulation of narratives and images. They can reproduce imperial clichés, but they can also expose them. The speed and reach 
            of contemporary media mean that memory is no longer only retrospective; it is formed in real time, contested publicly, and revised 
            continuously.
        </p>

        <p>
            Decolonization, in this context, should not be understood solely as a political slogan or a historical event. It is an ongoing 
            cultural practice: a gradual re-evaluation of symbols, languages, and inherited narratives. Importantly, decolonization is not 
            about erasing the past but about expanding the field of memory so that multiple experiences can coexist without hierarchical 
            subordination.
        </p>

        <p>
            Moving beyond empire is therefore less an act of negation than an act of re-imagination. Literature and media open space for 
            plural identities and layered histories, allowing societies to reinterpret their past without remaining bound to inherited myths. 
            Cultural memory becomes not a monument carved in stone, but a living, revisable structure that evolves as new voices enter the 
            conversation.
        </p>
