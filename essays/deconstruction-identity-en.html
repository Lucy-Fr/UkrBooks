      <p>
        Sometimes major intellectual shifts begin not with journal articles or programmatic manifestos,
        but with short posts on social media. A few paragraphs written without academic pathos can capture
        what university texts take years to formulate. This is what happened with a note by a scholar of
        Russian studies who tried to describe her position after 2022 — not as a political declaration,
        but as an inner state of a person whose professional identity suddenly lost its familiar center.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are no loud theses or theoretical references in this post. There is an admission of awkwardness.
        The author says it is difficult for her to identify with Slavic studies, yet even harder to abandon it
        entirely. What is at stake is a subtle shift: a discipline stops being a neutral framework and turns
        into a question of personal self-definition. For a long time, being a “specialist in Russia” in Western
        academia meant having a clearly recognizable niche. After the full-scale war began, that niche became
        vulnerable, suspicious, and oddly in demand at the same time — as if what was expected from the
        researcher was not knowledge but an ethnic or cultural “key” to an entire country.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the French academic environment she describes, Russian studies had already been moving toward
        empirical and sociological research. It was a discipline largely dependent on access to sources:
        trips, archives, interviews, field experience. After 2022 this familiar infrastructure was shaken.
        Geographical access disappeared, and confidence in the legitimacy of previous methods wavered.
        The researcher found herself in the position of someone whose tools had been suddenly taken away
        without new ones being offered.
      </p>

      <p>
        The academic community’s response was quick and largely collective. Real-time seminars appeared,
        discussions on the edge of scholarship and civic discourse emerged, and attempts were made to rethink
        the very structure of the discipline. Some turned to open digital sources; others spoke of
        decentralization — shifting attention from a single “big center” to networks of regions and comparative
        frameworks. The word “decolonization” entered the air, often less as a slogan than as a tone of fatigue
        with automatic Russocentrism.
      </p>

      <p>
        It is telling that one of the most precise instruments of reflection turned out to be the podcast.
        Voice, pauses, intonation — everything usually cleaned out of academic prose — suddenly mattered.
        Conversations included methodological doubts and personal stories: journeys, friendships, first scholarly
        impressions. For many researchers, Russia had been an object of study and part of their biography — a
        place where professional and personal identities were formed. The loss of the “center” therefore felt
        like the loss of coordinates.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Facebook note is valuable because it captures this layer — existential rather than political or
        institutional. It does not defend empire and does not call for rupture. It shows how a person raised
        within a certain cultural and academic architecture experiences its collapse. This is not nostalgia for
        a state or ideology. It is nostalgia for a structure of the world in which one’s profession was
        self-evident, the object of study legitimate, and the language “big” without constant justification.
      </p>

      <p>
        The comments reveal a small but telling debate. Some argue for abandoning the very idea of a center —
        refusing to build one’s life around any symbolic metropolis. Others emphasize gradual change: attitudes
        toward language and country evolve over years, and crisis merely accelerates an existing drift.
        Their tones differ, yet they converge on one point — the discussion is less about Russia than about how
        to live without a former anchor.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the end, this short post performs a task academic texts rarely dare to attempt: it connects discipline
        and biography. It shows that scholarly identity grows out of methods and publications as well as
        friendships, youthful journeys, and first discoveries. When the center collapses, research optics change,
        and so does the inner “I” — the one that usually remains invisible in university documents.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is why such texts matter. They offer no ready-made answers and no universal solutions. They fix a
        transitional moment — a state “after the center,” when the old coordinate system no longer works and the
        new one is not yet built. In this interval a rare honesty appears: the possibility to speak about what we
        study and about who we become when the familiar world ceases to be self-evident.
